# Introduction

Welcome to Alle! Alle is a modern task application inspired by the simplicity and elegance of TeuxDeux. It's designed to be a playground for exploring modern web development techniques, with a focus on clean architecture, type safety, and a great developer experience.

Our goal is to build a beautiful, functional, and maintainable application that's a joy to work on. We believe that good software is built on a solid foundation, which is why we've put a lot of thought into the project's structure, coding standards, and development workflows.

Whether you're here to learn, contribute, or just take a look around, we're glad to have you!
