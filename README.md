# Alle 🕺

Welcome to Alle, a modern task application that's as fun to develop as it is to use! Inspired by the clean and simple interface of TeuxDeux, Alle is our playground for building a beautiful, functional, and maintainable app from the ground up.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

Alle is a **monorepo** built with a modern tech stack that's designed for a great developer experience. Here's a quick look at what's under the hood:

*   **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) — A fast, modern, and powerful toolchain for building user interfaces.
*   **Backend**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) — An incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager, all in one.
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — For type safety and a better developer experience.
*   **Architecture**: [Adapter Pattern](./docs/03-architecture.md) — A clean and modular architecture that makes the app easy to extend and maintain.
*   **Code Quality**: [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) — For formatting and linting, to keep our code clean and consistent.

## ⚡️ Getting Started

Ready to jump in? Here's how to get Alle up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Run the development servers**:

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

That's it! The client will be running at `http://localhost:3000` and the server at `http://localhost:4000`.
